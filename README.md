# hcde-410-final

**===== Abstract =====**

The attached files are part of an analysis of the Enchantments Permit Lottery dataset as released by the U.S. Forest Service. Analyses were conducted in Google Sheets and showed that there were, indeed, certain combinations that could increase one's chances of winning a permit. Specifically, applicants should (1) aim to fill out at least 2, if not all 3, preference options, (2) apply for permit dates that fall on a Sunday, (3) apply for permit dates earlier or later in the June 29-September 20 relatively acceptable season dates, (4) apply for permit dates directly on the July 4th holiday, or (5) apply for permits for the week before the Labor Day Weekend holiday. A pattern emerged where most groups awarded permits were even-numbered (groups of 2, 4, 6, or 8) versus odd-numbered (1, 3, 5, or 7), but the cause for that cannot be determined with the given data. Follow-ups to the study may attempt to breakdown the data into more detailed analyses (e.g., Core-Zone only), look at a week-before and week-after change in applications for each day, compare 2019 and 2020 changes in more depth, or request more data from the USFS via the FOIA.


**===== Overview =====**

Included within is a proposal and consequent analysis for an HCDE 410 final project. Plan A was about using Washington Trails Association (WTA) trail data to find any correlations between a hike’s location from Seattle with its popularity, or a hike’s perceived difficulty as defined by its length with its overall rating. Plan B was about using the U.S. Forest Service’s publicly released permit lottery data to identify which dates and combinations are most optimal for attempting to secure an overnight trip permit to the protected Enchantments region. 

As of May 16, 2021, the decision was made to go with Plan B due to permission not being granted for Plan A and the more realistic time expectation for Plan B. The datasets to be analyzed can be found on the U.S. Forest Service's website [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20201020211744/https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd695975.pdf) (2019) and [here](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd695975.pdf) (2020). The research will attempt to uncover which days offer the greatest chance of winning the overnight permit lottery, and how much of an impact different days and group sizes have on the probability of winning a permit.

Freedom of Information Act (FOIA):
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which can be found in Title 5 of the United States Code, section 552, was enacted in 1966 and provides that any person has the right to request access to federal agency records or information. All agencies of the United States government are required to disclose records upon receiving a written request for them, except for those records that are protected from disclosure by the nine exemptions and three exclusions of the FOIA. This right of access is enforceable in court. The federal FOIA does not, however, provide access to records held by state or local government agencies, or by private businesses or individuals. All states have their own statutes governing public access to state and local records; state agencies should be consulted for further information about them.
