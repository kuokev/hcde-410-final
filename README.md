# hcde-410-final

**===== Abstract =====**



**===== Overview =====**

Included within is a proposal presenting two possible final projects for HCDE 410. Plan A is about using Washington Trails Association (WTA) trail data to find any correlations between a hike’s location from Seattle with its popularity, or a hike’s perceived difficulty as defined by its length with its overall rating. Plan B is about using the U.S. Forest Service’s publicly released permit lottery data to identify which dates and combinations are most optimal for attempting to secure an overnight trip permit to the protected Enchantments region. 

As of May 16, 2021, the decision was made to go with Plan B due to permission not being granted for Plan A and the more realistic time expectation for Plan B. The datasets to be analyzed can be found on the U.S. Forest Service's website [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20201020211744/https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd695975.pdf) (2019) and [here](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd695975.pdf) (2020). The research will attempt to uncover which days offer the greatest chance of winning the overnight permit lottery, and how much of an impact different days and group sizes have on the probability of winning a permit.

Freedom of Information Act:
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which can be found in Title 5 of the United States Code, section 552, was enacted in 1966 and provides that any person has the right to request access to federal agency records or information. All agencies of the United States government are required to disclose records upon receiving a written request for them, except for those records that are protected from disclosure by the nine exemptions and three exclusions of the FOIA. This right of access is enforceable in court. The federal FOIA does not, however, provide access to records held by state or local government agencies, or by private businesses or individuals. All states have their own statutes governing public access to state and local records; state agencies should be consulted for further information about them.
