    "# Motivation and Problem Statement\n",
    "My original Plan A was too ambitious and I was unable to receive proper permission for using the website data (see Data Selected for Analysis for details on why that is), so I decided to go with Plan B! \n",
    "\n",
    "The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) operates an annual lottery for overnight camping permits in the Enchantments. The Enchantments are a popular area for hikers in the state of Washington, but to protect the plants and animals in the area, the USFS limits entry into the area via a permit system. Each year, hopeful hikers must register for the lottery for a chance to get a permit. Hikers must select their top 3 choices for an entry day and the zone within the Enchantments they want to visit, the “Core Zone” being the most popular. In the 2019 and 2020 cycles, the raw data of applicants was also released publicly via PDFs. While the USFS posts a summary PDF on the most popular days, which gives potential applicants an idea of what days to avoid, I wonder if analysis can be done to identify the combinations that optimize the chances of a hiker being selected. Since the lottery strives to fill up each day’s allotte permits to the maximum, I wonder if single-hiker applicants also have an increased chance of entry if they are used to fill in the remainders, and if so, by how much. \n",
    "\n",
    "I am interested in Plan B because of its topic being related to the outdoors. There's also some more personal benefits related to learning what day, zone, and party size combinations might be best to score an Enchantments permit, which I have not managed to do yet. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Selected for Analysis\n",
    "For Plan B, the permit lottery data is available from [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20201020211744/https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd695975.pdf) (2019) and [here](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd695975.pdf) (2020). The PDFs can be converted into spreadsheet format via Google Sheets. While the license is not explicity stated within the page or the PDF, the USFS is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has a website “Digital Rights and Copyright” section that states, “Most information presented on the USDA Web site is considered public domain information. Public domain information may be freely distributed or copied, but use of appropriate byline/photo/image credits is requested. Attribution may be cited as follows: “U.S. Department of Agriculture… Some material on the USDA Web site are protected by copyright, trademark, or patent, and/or are provided for personal use only… and USDA has made every attempt to identify and clearly label them.” The lottery data is assumed to be available to be public domain, given that the lottery is held by the USFS, the document is not labeled as being copyrighted, and the dataset does not have any personal information. The dataset is appropriate for analyzing Plan B because it is the only known dataset containing Enchantments permit lottery data, as it’s coming from the lottery operator (the USFS). There does not appear to be any immediate ethical concerns with using the dataset, aside from potentially increasing one’s chances of gaining a permit should the resulting analysis be accurate. If the days to select or methods of increasing one’s chances of receiving a permit is released publicly, an influx of applicants may try to submit information that increase their chances of obtaining a permit. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Unknowns and Dependencies\n",
    "Plan A contained more unknowns, since it is a lengthier project that would require scraping for data. The need to scrape for data already introduces complications, such as if permission isn’t granted, or if the scraper does not work as intended. Naturally, because Plan A contained an additional data scraping step, it was also at higher risk than Plan B of running behind schedule or not being able to complete in time by the end of the quarter. As a graduating senior, I have a commitment to capstone, as well as gaining a full-time job post-graduation, and moving out of my current apartment back home which will also require a significant time investment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while Plan A was more interesting, Plan B seemed to be more feasible since it required an already-provided dataset, is a smaller dataset, and has a smaller set of possible questions to be answered (e.g., less time needed to choose what exactly to analyze). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Research Questions/Hypotheses\n",
    "Permission was not granted to scrape the Washington Trails Association's (WTA) Webmaster to analyze its trail-related data. In addition, the time commitment for Plan A was already long. As a result, I will be choosing Plan B, which is about exploring the Enchantments Permit Lottery System. Questions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the average probability of winning the permit lottery for trips starting on each day of the week?\n",
    "* What is the likelihood of winning the permit lottery on a weekend day compared to a weekday day? \n",
    "* What is the likelihood of winning the permit lottery depending on group size?\n",
    "* Is it more likely to win the lottery as a single-person party versus a group with 2+ people?\n",
    "* Which days provide the greatest chance of winning the permit lottery? \n",
    "\n",
    "# Background\n",
    "With the increasing population and increasing prevalence of scenic viewpoints being shared on social media, comes an increased amount of traffic to recreational areas, and greater strain on the resources within them. As a result, permit systems have been implemented by various land-managing agencies like the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, and U.S. Forest Service. With the creation of the Recreation.gov website in the early 2000's, it's been even easier for land-managing agencies to set up, run, and hold reservation lotteries via the integrated system. Since each permit lottery holds slight variations, it doesn't look like there's been a specific study on the overall recreational permit lottery system as a whole; meanwhile, the Enchantments lottery is at too small of a scale to have had much popularity for research studies. However, it is possible to view some related real-life phenomena that lends possible credence to the research questions being asked. For instance, single-person parties might have greater chances of winning the permit lottery because of their increased flexibility—that is, if there is only one additional space for the day, any other group that's 2 or more wouldn't be able to \"win\" that last spot for the day. In the realm of theme parks, we see places like Disneyland offer single rider queues where lone individuals can fill in the remaining seats for a ride. On [Mousehacking.com](https://www.mousehacking.com/blog/disney-world-single-rider-lines), it's claimed that the single rider line can save 25-50% off wait times. There's also clear evidence that weekends are tougher to win the outdoor permit lottery. People are likely to prefer venturing outdoors when they're not working, or when they can minimize time off, and for most people, that's Friday night to Sunday. Yosemite National Park runs a [similar lottery system](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/hdpermits.htm) for Half Dome where they saw that in the 2018 season, the \"average success rate on weekdays was 47%, but only 24% on weekends.\" Likewise, the Mt. Whitney lottery [shows similar trends](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd617167.pdf) where Fridays and Saturdays experienced increased demand and competition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the name of the game seems to be flexibility, and increased flexibility allows individuals to choose and participate in the permit lottery in a way that maximizes their chance of winning. Yet, how much of an advantage applies in the case of the Enchantments lottery in terms of the day and group size? Is there even an advantage as imagined? That's what the research hopes to find out.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Methodology\n",
    "Much of the analyses will be about summarizing the data into more digestible forms than the raw row-by-row data and then comparing the numbers to spot any differences. To verify statistical significance between different variables and scenarios, the t-test will be used. The data may be visualized in a variety of diagrams and charts, including a table of the most-likely days to win the permit lottery, a bar chart comparing the successful and unsuccessful application percentages by group size, and a time series graph to trend the number of permit applications over the course of the season. The table will be a helpful way to answer the question of which days will provide the greatest chance of winning the lottery. Meanwhile, the bar charts can help convey the likelihood of winning a permit by group size and day of the week. The time series chart can help show a more holistic view of the hiking season versus single day-by-day views or summaries. For instance, a time series can show the highest peaks (most competitive) and lowest valleys (least competitive) time periods. To conduct the analysis, the data from the U.S. Forest Service will likely be cleaned up and stored inside a Python dictionary, which will allow for the statistical work to happen via access to Python's statistical and visualization libraries.

    "Due to time limitations, I opted to complete the preparation, cleaning, and analysis of the dataset in Google Sheets.

I've tried to explain the process done in Google Sheets to the best of my ability to aid in any reproducing and replication of the results.

The files were then uploaded to Google Sheets for initial observation and cleaning. Adobe Acrobat was chosen because of the unreliability of 3rd party conversion services.

    "\n",
    "One of the first factors explored was group size. I wanted to understand how group size might impact one's chances of winning the permit lottery, with the hypothesis being that smaller group sizes should increase probability of winning due to their increased flexibility (e.g., single member parties can fill in the remainder). \n",

    "4. In Column L, find all matches to the group size from Column K in Column J. A function like \"=COUNTIF($J$2:$J, 8)\" can be used where $J$2:$J is the range of cells to count once each time there's a match, and 8 being the group size number (which will go down all the way to 1). \n",
    "5. The value of each cell in Column L is then fivided by the total of all awarded permits (the sum of all cells in Column L). The resulting percentage is saved in cells in Column M. \n",

    "Table A. Percent of Awarded Permits Given to Each Group Size\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"enchantments_groupsize.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the above table, there’s something unexpected going on with group sizes where people seem to choose even-numbered groups: parties of 2, 4, 6, and 8. Meanwhile, the odd number groups occur less frequently. A striking example is from sizes 6-8, where 15.66% of awarded permits went to groups of 6, then down to 0.92% for groups of 7, then back up to 21.4% for groups of 8. Because the dataset does not include group sizes for non-awarded applications, it is impossible to know the cause. One of the possible causes could be user demand. If user demand is the cause, then even-numbered groups may represent a larger amount of awarded permits because even-numbered group sizes work best for people. For parties of 2, maybe it's a nice trip with a friend or loved one. For groups of 4, maybe it's because that's how many people comfortably fit into most cars. For groups of 8, maybe it's just aiming for the maximum group size allowed. Meanwhile, parties of 1 might be undesirable because of safety concerns. The cause could also be the application system. If the number of people allowed inside a zone is an even number, odd-numbered groups may actually have a disadvantage if they go one-over the allowed amount of people. for those playing it safe, based on the data, even-numbered groups may be the way to go; however, the actual chance for each group size to get a permit cannot be pinpointed due to lack of complete data. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Number of Preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "Another factor to explore was the number of preferences a party had listed. Leaders are able to input between 1 and 3 different zone and date combinations.

    "3. List out the 3 preference amounts—3, 2, and 1—in Column B. \n",
    "4. Count the number of matches there are in Column A to each of the preference numbers in Column B using a function in Column C like \"=COUNTIF(A2:A, \"3\")\" where A2:A is where the number of preferences listed in the permit is and \"3\" is one of the three possible preference amounts. \n",
    "5. To find the total amount of applicants with 3, 2, or 1 option preferences, go back to the \"Copy of 2020\" sheet. In the \"Results Status\" column, change the filter to \"Awarded\" and \"Unsuccessful.\" \n",
    "6. Then, set a filter on the \"# of preferences\" column to 3 only, then 2 only, then 1 only. Each time the # of preferences filter is set, highlight the entire # of preferences column. In the bottom right-hand corner, click on the summary value and select \"Count.\" Go back to the \"# Pref + Group Size (2020)\" sheet and record each value manually in Column D.\n",
    "7. Double-check the results in Column C and Column D of the \"# Pref + Group Size (2020)\" sheet by running a SUM check of the 3 values in column C and Column D. Column C should equal the count in Column A excluding the header. Column D should equal the total number of applicants excluding cancelled permits. \n",
    "8. Divide each Column C value by the corresponding Column D value (left-right pairs), multiply by 100, and record the value in Column E. That's the percent chance that someone was awarded a permit from that specific # of preferences group.\n",
    "9. Divide each Column C value by the sum of all values in Column C. Record the results in Column F to see how many permits were awarded to that # of preferences group among all awarded permits. \n",
    "10. Divide each Column D value by the sum of all values in Column D. Record the results in Column G to see how many groups had the same # of preferences out of all applications, excluding cancelled permits. \n",
    "11. In the \"Copy of 2019\" sheet, copy all the values in Column Q (# of preferences) into Column A of a new sheet called \"# Pref (2019).\" \n",
    "12. In Column B, write out the 3 # of preference options (3, 2, and 1). \n",
    "13. In Column C, collect the count of each # of preference occurrence using a function like \"=COUNTIF(A2:A, \"3\")\" (the same one used in step 4). \n",
    "14. In Column D, use a function like \"=C2/COUNT(A2:A) * 100\" to divide each value in column C by the sum of all values in Column C, which shows how many groups had the same # of preferences out of all applications for the 2019 permit year. Values in Column D can be compared with the \"# Pref + Group Size (2020)\" sheet's Column G (% of all apps (2020)) values.\n",

    "<img src=\"enchantments_preferences.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "From Table B, we can see that it's very important for groups to have at least 2 preferences. While the decrease in chances among groups with only 2 preferences rather than 3 is minimal (-0.4%), the decrease in chances among groups with only 1 preference rather than 3 is quite substantial (-3.44%). The results make sense too, logically. Groups with more flexibility in terms of zone and date options will likely have a better chance of being placed. With only 1 option, groups only have 1 chance at an availability. Meanwhile, those with 2 or 3 choices have more leeway.\n",
    "\n",
    "From 2019 to 2020, we also see an increase in groups taking full advantage of the 3 preferences (an increase to 96.5% of all applicants from 95.9%). So, people are playing it smarter. Based on the percentage of all awarded permits compared to the percentage of all applicants, those with 3 preferences were overrepresented in the awarded permits area, with 97.1% awarded to groups with 3 preferences versus groups with 3 preferences representing only 96.5% of all applicants in 2020. Thus, the other metrics back up the finding that it's important to list out all 3 preferences, but if not, at least 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: \"cancelled\" permits were excluded, since it is unclear if these permits were included in the lottery or not (e.g., were these cancelled prior to the run of the random lottery?)

In fact, for the Core zone, the most sought-after zone in the Enchantments, a whopping 67.1% of applicants who were awarded a permit were given their first choice. While it can neither be confirmed nor denied with the available data, it may be possible to surmise that the lottery system randomly chooses an applicant, then looks to see if that applicant's choice(s) are available before moving on to the next winning applicant. \n",

    "The findings suggest the obvious: more flexibility is better. More dates selected? That's better. Trip dates earlier or later in the season when temperatures are a bit colder and there could be some snow on the ground? That's better. However, it also reveals interesting patterns. For instance, odd-numbered groups made up a smaller percentage of the awarded permits. In addition, there was noticeable inflexibility of people when making their 2nd and 3rd choice preferences. Rather than try and shift the start date to days of the week that were less popular, the majority of groups opted to try for the more competitive days (e.g., Friday and Saturday). \n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, it is important to note the limitations of the study, of which there are certainly a couple. First off, the 2019 and 2020 datasets included different data fields, which limited analysis between the two (e.g., one had awarded permits data and group size data, but the other didn't). \n",
    "\n",
    "The details of the lottery process itself also hasn't been released. For instance, does the lottery choose a person and then look at their preferences to decide whether they get a permit or not based on available space? Or, does the lottery go day-by-day in the permit season, selecting people randomly based on those who had chosen that day? While assumptions can be made based on the results, it's an assumption, and there are caveats to be aware with all assumptions. Patterns may emerge and be present, but that may be caused by random chance."

    "Ultimately, the research seeks to better understand the factors involved in winning the Enchantments Permit lottery, and the results do appear to follow the logical thoughts someone might have when thinking about ways to increase their chances of receiving an Echantments Permit. To increase one's chances of winning the lottery, an applicant should be as flexible as possible. In terms of preferences, it means filling out ALL 3 options. While filling out only 2 options does not greatly decrease chances, only filling 1 option almost halves one's chances of getting a permit. Meanwhile, applicants should consider starting their trips on Sunday, which is by far the least in-demand of the days of the week. Permits are most competitive during the middle of the season around August 14th; however, the Enchantments are often mostly snow-free well before and after the peak time, so individuals can try to schedule trips earlier in the season (for wildflowers) or later in the season (for larches). \n",

    "Regarding the \"Number of Preferences\" analysis, I wish I had more time to look into the actual amount of applicants who selected each zone for their 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choices. It may be interesting to see which zone(s) applicants fall back to after the Core zone (so filter the data to just those who selected Core zone as their 1st choice, then count the occurrences of each zone in the 2nd and 3rd choice columns). \n",

    "Unfortunately, the dataset's limitations and my personal time available limited the amount of analysis that could be conducted. In the future, researchers may consider submitting a FOIA request to the USFS to gain access to additional permit lottery data to allow for greater comparison across the years. They may also be able to obtain data like the group sizes for applications that were unsuccessful. "
